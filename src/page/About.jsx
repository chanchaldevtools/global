                    <p className="about_sec1_p_1">
                      When asked why Roger and Tracy started O2 Global Inc, Roger
                      replied, "I have been blessed with the ability to foresee and
                      navigate market trends in the ever changing economy,
                      ultimately creating multiple streams of income. In searching
                      for the perfect balance in a company, I continue to create
                      products and services that could create an equitable and
                      profitable incentive plan for acquiring customers and teaching
                      others to do the same. When seeing the current business
                      landscape and understanding what it takes to succeed in
                      today’s business climate, the desire of the executive
                      management team is to continue to provide the ability to
                      improve lives around the world, not only financially, but also
                      through lifestyle, relationships, and emotional development.”

                      Roger and Tracy met in 1997 and solidified their relationship
                      in 2004. At that time, Tracy was pursuing a teaching degree in
                      college, while Roger had already dedicated nearly a decade to
                      building a successful team, which eventually disbanded
                      following the collapse of the company they worked for.
                      Following this setback, Roger spent the next two decades
                      consulting for numerous network marketing companies, striving
                      to recreate the success he once enjoyed. Realizing that the
                      key to finding success was to create it himself, Roger took
                      the initiative to establish his own path. A passionate and
                      driven professional, Roger attributes his achievements to his
                      core values and upbringing. His true fulfillment comes from
                      helping others achieve their dreams, aligning his career with
                      his calling to improve lives. Roger's expertise in direct
                      marketing encompasses everything from conception to launch
                      planning, bonus plan development and implementation, marketing
                      strategies, training systems, team building, product
                      development, organizational launch and pre-launch structure
                      and management, to conventions, seminars, set and stage
                      design, and recognition systems. Roger’s dedication to his
                      profession and commitment to others underscores his passion
                      for transforming lives through innovative and effective
                      marketing strategies.

                        We understand that travel transforms individuals and fosters
                        cultural understanding, and contributes to the preservation
                        of our world’s natural and cultural heritage. With this in
                        mind, we set out on a mission to curate exceptional travel
                        experiences that cater to different interests, preferences,
                        and budgets. And so, Escape Trips became our first initial
                        product offering.
